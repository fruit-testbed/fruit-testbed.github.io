The Pi Stack PCB is a custom developed PCB which can be used to create clusters, known as 'stacks' of Raspberry Pi compatible single board computers.  The Pi Stack was came out of the experiences of building Raspberry Pi clusters using other methods.  The <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/362918/">first</a> cluster created used Lego as the physical mounting structure.  This approach held the raspberry pis together conveniently, but did not help with cable management.  The Pi Stack was designed to address this issue.

Key Features:
<ul>
<li> Stackable design</il>
<li> Power management available for each Pi</il>
<li> Remote power control</il>
<li> Remove power monitoring</il>
<li> Heartbeat monitoring for each Pi</il>
<li> Eliminates the need for separate power connectors</il>
</ul>

Status:
The Pi Stack board is still early in the development phase.  It is currently being tested by the project partners, the results of which will be published as an academic paper.  Upon successful completion of these tests we will consider the production of more Pi Stack boards and making them available to other interested parties.
